Hal needs to form his team. He chooses green lanters whose enrolement number and the sector to which they belong satisfy certain property - Prime Frequency.

Input:
The first line consists of an integer T(<=1000), the number of test cases. Then T lines follow.
Each test case consists of two integers n(sector number) and k(green lanter enrolement no.). n (<=10^100) and given a number k (k<=1000000).

Output:
For each test case. Print the number of primes below k that divides n and then print them in increasing order in the same line, separating consecutive primes by a space.

Sample Input:
2
10 3
20 6

Sample Output:
1 2
2 2 5

Your code must be designed to run on 20 processes using MPI.
